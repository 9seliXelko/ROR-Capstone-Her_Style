Many players who bought the game soon after its release faced a series of technical problems that made the game unplayable on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 consoles. Some of the issues included the game crashing unexpectedly, freezing during gameplay and corrupting the file saves that stored the players' progress.[55] On 26 November 2012, IO Interactive, the developer of the game, acknowledged the problems and assured the players that they were working hard to find and fix the errors. However, they also admitted that they did not know the exact cause of the errors, which meant that it might take a long time before they could release a patch to solve them.[56]

Despite the patches, some players still experienced technical issues with the game.

Some players also complained about the game's optimization and performance, especially on lower-end PCs or older consoles. The game's technical issues affected its reception and sales, as some critics and players criticized the game for being buggy and poorly optimized.
