The book is divided into 14 chapters, each covering a specific topic in statistics and probability. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of statistics, such as variables, data types, graphs, measures of central tendency, and measures of dispersion. The second chapter deals with the basic rules and principles of probability, such as events, sample spaces, conditional probability, independence, Bayes' theorem, and counting techniques. The third chapter introduces the concept of random variables and their properties, such as expectation, variance, standard deviation, and covariance. The fourth chapter discusses the most common discrete probability distributions, such as binomial, Poisson, geometric, hypergeometric, and negative binomial. The fifth chapter covers the most common continuous probability distributions, such as uniform, exponential, normal, gamma, beta, and chi-square.
 
The sixth chapter explains the concept of sampling and sampling distributions, such as sampling methods, sampling error, sampling distribution of the mean, sampling distribution of the proportion, central limit theorem, and standard error. The seventh chapter introduces the concept of estimation and confidence intervals, such as point estimation, interval estimation, confidence level, margin of error, t-distribution, and z-distribution. The eighth chapter deals with the concept of hypothesis testing and significance tests, such as null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistic, p-value, type I error, type II error, power of a test, one-tailed test, two-tailed test, t-test, z-test, and chi-square test.
 
The ninth chapter discusses the concept of correlation and regression analysis, such as scatter plot, correlation coefficient, linear regression, least squares method, coefficient of determination, residual analysis, and inference for regression. The tenth chapter covers the concept of analysis of variance (ANOVA), such as one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, F-test, and multiple comparisons. The eleventh chapter introduces the concept of nonparametric statistics, such as rank tests, sign test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Friedman test. The twelfth chapter deals with the concept of categorical data analysis, such as contingency table, chi-square test for independence, chi-square test for goodness-of-fit, and Fisher's exact test. The thirteenth chapter explains the concept of quality control and improvement, such as control charts, process capability analysis, acceptance sampling, and Pareto chart. The fourteenth chapter covers some special topics in statistics and probability, such as Bayesian statistics, decision theory, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo simulation.
 
The book also provides several appendices that contain useful information and tables for reference, such as mathematical formulas, statistical tables, and answers to selected exercises. The book also comes with a companion website that offers additional resources and materials for students and instructors, such as online quizzes, practice problems, data sets, lecture slides, and solutions manual.
