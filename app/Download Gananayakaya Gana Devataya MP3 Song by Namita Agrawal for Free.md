Lord Ganesha has many attributes and symbols that convey his qualities and powers. He has four arms, which signify his omnipresence and omnipotence. In his upper right hand, he holds a paraÅu (axe), which he uses to cut off attachments and worldly desires. In his upper left hand, he holds a pÄÅa (noose), which he uses to capture and subdue the negative forces. In his lower right hand, he holds an aá¹kuÅa (elephant goad), which he uses to guide and discipline his devotees. In his lower left hand, he holds a modak (round sweet), which represents the reward of spiritual practice and the joy of life. [^2^]
  
Lord Ganesha rides on a mouse, which symbolizes his ability to overcome anything to get what he wants. The mouse also represents the mind, which can be controlled by Ganesha's wisdom and grace. The mouse can also gnaw through any obstacle or barrier, just like Ganesha can remove any hurdle in the path of his devotees. [^2^]
  
Lord Ganesha is celebrated in many festivals throughout the year, but the most important one is Ganesh Chaturthi, which falls on the fourth day of the waxing moon in the month of Bhadrapada (AugustâSeptember). On this day, devotees install clay idols of Ganesha in their homes or public places and worship him with prayers, offerings, and chants. The idols are immersed in water after 1, 3, 5, 7 or 11 days, symbolizing the return of Ganesha to his abode in Mount Kailash with his parents Shiva and Parvati. The immersion also signifies the dissolution of the ego and the attachment to material things. [^1^]
